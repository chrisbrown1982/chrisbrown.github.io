I am a lecturer in the [School of Computer Science](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/computer-science/) at the [University of St Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/), Scotland, UK. I am a member of the [Programming Languages](https://plrg.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/) group.

Before becoming a lecturer, I was previously a post-doc at St Andrews, and previous to that, I worked in industry briefly, after graduating from my PhD from the University of kent. 

My research ambition lately has generally been focussed around building new tools and techniques to make it easier and more accessible, through the use of refactoring technology, for application programmers to develop multi-core software. But I am generally interested in programming languages, and compilers. My area of expertise lies in refactoring, programming languages, including functional programming, parallel programming, programming language design (including semantics, and formal reasoning), compilers and GPU programming. Based on the research that I undertook as part of my PhD, I have developed new refactoring tools and techniques for parallel computing systems, for a variety of languages, including C/C++, Haskell and Erlang. These provide software developers with much-needed tool capabilities to allow them to easily and effectively exploit modern multi-core hardware, enabling their applications to run faster, safer and with less development effort and expertise. 

I am strongly active amongst the programming language and parallelism communities, where I contribute heavily to the design and implementation of refactoring tools and compiler technology (leading to two refactoring tools, HaRe, for Haskell and ParaFormance, for C/C++); parallel programming (including a new parallel skeleton library for Erlang, Skel); GPU programming; and the design, implementation and application of functional programming languages.


Postgraduate Students
------
I am currently working with [Yasir Alguwaifli](https://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/directory/person?id=ya8) on researching into heuristic and MOO techniques for energy profiling in multi-cores.

I am very keen to find research students who will work me on any of these (or related) topics:

<ul>
<li>refactoring multi-core</li>
<li>refactoring for energy-aware systems</li>
<li>energy-aware patterns and skeletons</li>
<li>non-functional properties of time, energy and security</li>
<li>program transformation</li>
<li>formal reasoning of refactoring systems and/or parallel programming</li>
<li>dependent types and refactoring</li>
</ul>
If you are interested in studying for a PhD or postgraduate study, please get in touch.
