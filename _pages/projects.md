Teamplay
---
I am currently the PI at St Andrews on an EU H2020 project, [Teamplay](https://www.teamplay-h2020.eu/).  

The TeamPlay project aims to develop new, formally-motivated, techniques that will allow execution time, energy usage, security, and other important non-functional properties of parallel software to be treated effectively, and as first- class citizens. We will build this into a toolbox for developing highly parallel software for low-energy systems, as required by the internet of things, cyber-physical systems etc.

At St Andrews, we are using dependent types, via [Idris](https://www.idris-lang.org/), to provide formal proof systems of assertions that programs meet their non-functional specifications.
